# Hiewdocs

This is some notes and online help for using [Hiew](http://www.hiew.ru) editor.

I really like Hiew, it's perfect for the tasks I do regularly in a hex editor.

I think new users might be discouraged because many features are not easily
discoverable, I thought some searchable online help might help.

> This project is very early and incomplete.

If you're a regular Hiew user, please help! Pull Requests, corrections, etc,
all appreciated.
